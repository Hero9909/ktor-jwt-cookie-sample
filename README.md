# ktor-jwt-cookie-sample
As i didnt found any direct examples for using ktor with jwt and transfere tokens via cookies, ive collected as much as i can respective to the KISS precept.
the project consists of one Application file for the server and a Secutity file for the jwt tokens and the cookies.

## Thanks
Thanks to AndreasVolkmann for his repo:

Thanks to ArchOrn for his issues at ktor #1297 as his code directed me to a simple solution to use cookies to save tokens

## Contributions
I'll be happy if anyone has the will to improve this project, as long as we keep this simple enaught that no more complexity is added, 
don't mind this if its for security, security is nothing we should measure, its something we should provide by default.
